                    <p>My career as a software engineer started 2012, During my career I've had the privilege of
                        architecting new systems with
                        <b>innovative</b> features, tackling the rewarding challenges of maintaining large legacy
                        codebases, and coaching
                        teams on the journey to build exceptional solutions.
                        My passion lies in delivering solutions of <b>high quality</b>.
                        I consistently strive for creative problem solving and solutions that are easy to read,
                        understand and test
                        and promotes <b>maintainability</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p>I'm driven, focused and often find myself in roles that involve <b>leadership</b>.
                        When explaining complex problems, I use analogies to bring new aspects and clarity.
                        I possess a <b>broad range</b> of technical expertise across various technologies and
                        languages. I consistently approach the challenge of <b>learning</b> new frameworks and languages
                        with enthusiasm.

                    <p> Played a pivotal role in modernising a clients' tech stack by leading a taskforce to
                        implement a new architecture focused on security, maintainability, and modern practices.
                        The architecture I created was composed by the following areas focusing on lowering
                        maintenance costs by an estimated 10%. I created 4 focus areas to achieve this result:
                    <ol class="achievements no-margin">
                        <li>
                            <b>Microservices Architecture</b> - Designed and implemented new API structures for
                            improved scalability and maintainability.
                            part of teh work was to add code conventions to for a more maintainable and highly testable solution.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Enhanced Security</b> - Single Sign-On authentication was introduced
                            across the entire stack (user and developer). New rolebase authentication that restricted user access to servers and systems.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>DevOps</b> - Introduced DevOps pipelines for automated build verification and
                            deployment, streamlining the development process.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Team Leadership</b> - Successfully transitioned the team to a Tech Lead structure,
                            promoting collaboration, creativity and ownership.
                        </li>

                        Reduced operational costs by an estimated 3-5% by leading a project to stream
                        audiobooks directly from existing GCP buckets.
                        This also eliminated data duplication and achieved a better global availability along with an improved 
                        security.

                        My coworker and I developed a concept for "tagging" real objects with virtual data using

                        It was initially for medical use (info about blood samples), but later pivoted toward
                        construction,
                        where the HoloLens concept could visualize hidden utilities such as power lines or plumbing.

                                I created a new scripting language to help the transition between a selfdeveloped custom hardware database and MS SQL.
